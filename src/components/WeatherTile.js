/*
Talking Points:
- The WeatherTile component is designed to present individual weather data points in a visually appealing way that aligns with the overall theme of the Weather Wizard app.
- I decided to enlarge the weather icons and use bold labels to ensure that each tile immediately conveys its information to the user.
- The additional description, "The Crystal Ball Speaks," is part of the magical theme that makes the weather data more engaging and consistent with the wizardry aesthetic.
- By using Tailwind CSS, I was able to quickly apply styling that ensures consistency across all tiles while maintaining flexibility for adjustments as needed.
- This component is essential for breaking down complex weather data into easily digestible pieces, making the app more user-friendly and enjoyable.
