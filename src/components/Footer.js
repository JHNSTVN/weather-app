// Footer Component
// This component is responsible for rendering the footer at the bottom of the web app.
// The footer includes a simple copyright notice for "Weather Wizardry © 2024."

const Footer = () => (
  <footer className="mt-12 text-center text-sm text-white">
    {/* The text here is centered and styled with Tailwind CSS to match the overall theme of the app */}
    <p>Weather Wizardry © 2024. All rights reserved.</p>
  </footer>
);

export default Footer;

/*
Talking Points:
- I designed the Footer component to provide a consistent ending section across all pages of the Weather Wizard application.
- The copyright notice ensures that users are aware of the app's ownership and the year of creation.
- I used Tailwind CSS for styling because it allows me to quickly and easily apply utility classes like `text-center` and `text-white` to ensure the footer matches the app's overall design.
- This component is small and straightforward, but it plays a crucial role in giving the app a professional look and feel.
