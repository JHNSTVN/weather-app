/*
Talking Points:
- The Home component is the main landing page of my Weather Wizard app, designed to welcome users and introduce them to the core functionality.
- I centered the content using Tailwind CSS classes like `min-h-screen`, `flex`, `items-center`, and `justify-center` to ensure that the page layout is balanced and visually appealing on all screen sizes.
- The headline "Welcome to Weather Wizardry" sets the tone for the app, aligning with the magical theme I've chosen for the user experience.
- By integrating the WeatherWand component directly into the home page, I ensure that users can immediately interact with the app's primary featureâ€”fetching and displaying weather data.
- The Footer component is included at the bottom of the page to provide consistent branding and closure to the user experience on this page.
- Overall, the Home component is designed to be both welcoming and functional, offering users a seamless introduction to what the Weather Wizard app has to offer.
